# Portable bundle

Checked 2026-10-27. Linux, Windows, and macOS CI pack this shape and smoke-test `/api/health`. Release workflow run [40526064339](https://github.com/Boom-Vitt/boombignose-erp-harness-ai/actions/runs/40526064339) printed `health ok` and `postgres stopped` on all three. The published v0.2.0 installers do not contain the tree.

## What the window does

`boombignose/internal/bundle` looks at `BOOMBIGNOSE_BUNDLE`, or at `bundle/` next to the desktop executable. Inside an AppImage that directory is `usr/bin/bundle`, beside the mounted binary.

Required files:

- `bundle/node` (`bundle/node.exe` on Windows)
- `bundle/erp/server.js`

When both exist and `127.0.0.1:3100` is closed, the window runs that Node binary with `server.js`. It does not look up `node` on `PATH` and it does not call Docker. The child environment sets `HOST` and `HOSTNAME` to `127.0.0.1` and `PORT` to the ERP port. It keeps `PATH`, `HOME`, `TMPDIR`, `LANG`, a loopback Supabase URL when the parent already has one, a loopback `OLLAMA_HOST`, and `OLLAMA_MODEL`. `LOCAL_TOTP_ENROLL` is copied only when the value is exactly `1`. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_MODEL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and `RESEND_API_KEY` are not passed to the ERP process. A hosted Supabase URL or a remote Ollama host is refused and the error does not include the value. The Node process does not receive the Postgres `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (that tree ships OpenSSL 1.1).

When those two files are absent, the window keeps the checkout path: `node scripts/local/stack.mjs serve --port 3100`.

`boombignose serve` starts the same stack and prints `ready` only after the ERP port accepts TCP. `boombignose stop`, and the window shutdown, stop the recorded Node pid and run `pg_ctl -m fast stop`.

## Postgres, not SQLite

The ERP's finance and stock rules are Postgres functions, and row access is RLS. A SQLite file cannot run them.

Linux CI downloads one pinned archive and checks it before packing:

- Node v22.21.1 linux-x64, SHA-256 `680d3f30b24a7ff24b98db5e96f294c0070f8f9078df658da1bce1b9c9873c88`, MIT license copied to `bundle/NODE_LICENSE`
- Zonky `embedded-postgres-binaries-linux-amd64` 16.10.0, jar SHA-256 `17a8ded28bde97fe66247387806af30ee26190fc96503c47c3eaa4fcbdcff8b6`, PostgreSQL License in `bundle/postgres/POSTGRESQL_LICENSE.txt`

The packed binaries are `bundle/postgres/bin/initdb`, `pg_ctl`, and `postgres`, plus `lib/` and `share/`. `prelude.sql` creates a local `auth` schema, `auth.uid()`, `auth.role()`, the roles `anon`, `authenticated`, and `service_role`, a `schema_migrations` table, and a small `storage` stub so the attachment migration can record a bucket. That prelude is not the Supabase auth server and it does not issue sessions.

Windows CI uses Node v22.21.1 win-x64, SHA-256 `3c624e9fbe07e3217552ec52a0f84e2bdc2e6ffa7348f3fdfb9fbf8f42e23fcf`, and Zonky `embedded-postgres-binaries-windows-amd64` 16.10.0, jar SHA-256 `8fbb986005ed7cfe486d6626a7859235a9713fadd164aff0b0a37ce1b65857d4`, inner archive `postgres-windows-x86_64.txz`. That archive lays out `bin/`, `lib/`, and `share/` (not `share/postgresql`). `initdb` on Windows uses `--no-locale`. The server options omit `unix_socket_directories`. The launcher does not set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` for that process.

macOS arm64 CI uses Node v22.21.1 darwin-arm64, SHA-256 `c170d6554fba83d41d25a76cdbad85487c077e51fa73519e41ac885aa429d8af`, and Zonky `embedded-postgres-binaries-darwin-arm64v8` 16.10.0, jar SHA-256 `8b1933ae6912399902ac901f2633f22c5e92ca81585297ba0e2b835e25208459`, inner archive `postgres-darwin-arm_64.txz`. The artifact name is `darwin-arm64v8`. `darwin-arm64` is not published. The layout is `bin/`, `lib/`, and `share/postgresql`. The launcher sets `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` to `lib/` for the Postgres binaries only. The assemble script clears the quarantine attribute and ad-hoc signs `node`, `initdb`, `pg_ctl`, and `postgres`. That signature is not a Developer ID.

The Next.js standalone server is built once, on Linux, and reused. `package.json` has no native runtime addon. Each platform still downloads its own Node and Postgres and checks the checksum before packing.

On first launch the data directory is `BOOMBIGNOSE_DATA` or `~/.local/share/boombignose/pg` (not inside the AppImage or DMG mount). A later version, including an upgrade from v0.3, reuses that directory when `postmaster.pid` names it and the process is still alive. If `127.0.0.1:54329` is open and the pid file does not match, startup stops and the error names `server.log` in that directory. If `127.0.0.1:3100` is open and `GET /api/health` is not `{"ok":true}`, startup stops and the splash shows the error instead of navigating. Uninstall removes the program files and leaves the data directory. A path containing a space is refused. `initdb` creates superuser `boombignose` with trust authentication. Unix `initdb` uses `--locale=C`. The launcher then creates database `boombignose`. The server listens on `127.0.0.1` port `54329` (`BOOMBIGNOSE_PG_PORT` overrides it). Each migration in `bundle/postgres/migrations` is applied once, in order, through one simple-query message, then recorded in `public.schema_migrations`. When Auth is bundled, those filenames are recorded in `public.erp_schema_migrations` instead, because Auth's runner already owns `public.schema_migrations`. Startup fails if `public.organizations` is missing. A later launch skips files that are already recorded. A run on this machine against the pinned Postgres 16.10 binaries recorded every file in `supabase/migrations`. The cluster was stopped afterward.

`GET /api/health` returns `{"ok":true}` without a database and without a cloud call. The Linux smoke test requires that response from `http://127.0.0.1:3100/api/health`. Release workflow run [40520719762](https://github.com/Boom-Vitt/boombignose-erp-harness-ai/actions/runs/40520719762) printed `health ok` and `postgres stopped`. The Windows smoke is `packaging/windows/smoke-bundle.ps1`. The macOS smoke is the same shell script as Linux. Run [40526064339](https://github.com/Boom-Vitt/boombignose-erp-harness-ai/actions/runs/40526064339) printed `health ok` and `postgres stopped` for both. The smoke then signs up and signs in through `http://127.0.0.1:54321/auth/v1`. That port is a loopback proxy to bundled Auth (formerly GoTrue) and PostgREST. Release workflow run [40536898121](https://github.com/Boom-Vitt/boombignose-erp-harness-ai/actions/runs/40536898121) on commit `cc20239` printed `health ok`, `signup ok`, `signin ok`, and `postgres stopped` on Linux, Windows, and macOS. That run was a pull request. The smoke boots a writable `dist/bundle`. It does not boot the server from a read-only DMG or AppImage mount. Tag `boombignose-v0.2.1` does not contain Auth or PostgREST.

Auth v2.197.0 and PostgREST v16.5 are MIT. Linux uses `auth-v2.197.0-amd64.tar.xz` SHA-256 `b5c2991d1df760c9b099c1c2395a94bd1c2f83ed58901934921997179dc9f7ea` and `postgrest-v16.5-linux-static-x86-64.tar.xz` SHA-256 `5099e7ada38f9f6846cd87c14c5f158b7c165f1e9959665ad412e61f4dceba95`. macOS uses `auth-v2.197.0-darwin-arm64.tar.gz` SHA-256 `3fb7998e7061e2c14f3f9555b1d94d447358c965395728e0d81eac82e0e5868b` and `postgrest-v16.5-macos-aarch64.tar.xz` SHA-256 `d8095cb439de0a3151036df542139e7afca5cebb109ce7f1bae52b3a97e9846a`. Windows uses `postgrest-v16.5-windows-x86-64.zip` SHA-256 `17f595b0d8dd37473d0231417dea07c5ac9f791282ff5b017fae51ff29e5de2f`. Upstream Auth v2.197.0 does not publish a Windows archive. Windows CI builds commit `4eee58f296d9698a1c2c0ae14d7a0b379c7622d3` and applies `packaging/auth/windows-no-reuseport.patch`. That commit sets `SO_REUSEPORT` before listen. The constant is not defined for windows/amd64, and one loopback listener does not need it. Linux and macOS keep the upstream archives. Auth's database connection sets `search_path` to `auth, public`. The cluster default stays `public`, so ERP migrations still create their tables there. The first launch also creates a nologin role named `postgres`, because an Auth migration grants to that role and `initdb -U boombignose` does not create it. Licenses are `bundle/auth/AUTH_LICENSE.txt` and `bundle/postgrest/POSTGREST_LICENSE.txt`.

Auth migrates its own schema before `prelude-after-auth.sql` and the ERP migrations. That prelude does not create `auth.users` or replace `auth.uid()`. The first launch writes `jwt.secret`, `anon.key`, and `service.key` in the data directory, mode `0600`. The service-role key is not compiled into the window. `GOTRUE_MAILER_AUTOCONFIRM` is true so the local sign-up does not send mail. This is still not a click of the login form.

## Ollama

The platform bundles pack Ollama v0.40.11. The archive checksum is checked before staging. The MIT license is `packaging/ollama/OLLAMA_LICENSE.txt`, SHA-256 `5934ed2ce0d15154bcdb9c85203210abac0da4314af34081e36df4599f90b226`, and it is copied to `bundle/ollama/OLLAMA_LICENSE.txt`.

Linux uses `ollama-linux-amd64.tar.zst`, SHA-256 `7bedab90dd122661be78798e9f0edf37fccf0cccf2699d2c58ea1a3afdc04b6d`. The binary is `bundle/ollama/bin/ollama`, with CPU and Vulkan runners in `bundle/ollama/lib/ollama`. Windows uses `ollama-windows-amd64.zip`, SHA-256 `bda4a493ba8a7c24d57263cd843cd68cee84f44aed4299eeed532acad7eda12a`. The binary is `bundle/ollama/ollama.exe`. macOS uses the universal `ollama-darwin.tgz`, SHA-256 `aea7d3f2e32371b7644a6e2ec8d4f26820a0e3965918cce8a46cef3e947f6291`. The binary is `bundle/ollama/ollama`, and the Metal runners stay beside it. `ollama --version` in the assemble script must print `0.40.11`. That check does not pull a model.

`cuda_v12` and `cuda_v13` are not copied from the Linux or Windows archives. Together they are about 2.3 GB uncompressed. NSIS compression is off, and a GitHub release asset has to stay under 2 GiB. The macOS archive has no CUDA directory, so it is packed in full. CPU inference of `qwen3:4b` uses the runners that remain. A machine that needs CUDA can install upstream Ollama separately; this bundle does not include those runners.

If `bundle/ollama/ollama` or `bundle/ollama/bin/ollama` is missing (`ollama.exe` on Windows), the window looks up `ollama` on `PATH`. If neither exists, startup continues.

When a binary exists and nothing is listening on `127.0.0.1:11434`, the window runs `ollama serve` with `OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434`. A remote host is refused. Startup does not download a model. `boombignose serve` does not start Ollama.

The model download is a separate action. The splash has a button labeled “ดาวน์โหลดโมเดล qwen3:4b”. Nothing clicks it. The command is:

```sh
boombignose pull-model
```

That runs `ollama pull qwen3:4b` with `OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11434`. The child environment does not receive cloud keys. The pull contacts the Ollama model registry to fetch the weights. Chat still goes to loopback. The startup process list refuses `pull`. CI does not run the pull.

## What is in which installer

The Linux tar.gz lists `bundle/node`, `bundle/erp/server.js`, `bundle/postgres/bin/postgres`, `bundle/auth/auth`, `bundle/postgrest/postgrest`, and `bundle/ollama/bin/ollama`. The AppImage copies the same tree to `usr/bin/bundle`. The NSIS script copies `bundle\` beside `BoomBigNose.exe`. A silent install checks those files, including `bundle\ollama\ollama.exe`, then the smoke boots that installed directory. The DMG copies `bundle` beside `BoomBigNose`. The mount check looks for `bundle/ollama/ollama`. The smoke copies the mount to a writable directory, because a read-only UDZO image can drop the executable bit, and boots that copy. NSIS compression is off. The Linux installer job also smokes the extracted tar.gz and the extracted AppImage. Those smokes are `health`, sign-up, and sign-in. They do not pull `qwen3:4b`. Workflow run [40549096601](https://github.com/Boom-Vitt/boombignose-erp-harness-ai/actions/runs/40549096601) on commit `0652c87` printed `health ok`, `signup ok`, `signin ok`, and `postgres stopped` for each of those four artifact boots.

Tag `boombignose-v0.2.0` is the older window-only release. Tag `boombignose-v0.2.1` packed Node, `server.js`, and portable Postgres. Workflow run 40537854881 required `/api/health` before upload and did not pack Auth, PostgREST, or Ollama. Tag `boombignose-v0.3.0` is the current non-prerelease download. `sha256sum -c` matched its four installer files. The source download page points at that tag. Pages run [40552775160](https://github.com/Boom-Vitt/boombignose-erp-harness-ai/actions/runs/40552775160) deployed it. The live page and `assets/favicon.svg`, `assets/logo.svg`, and `assets/og.png` returned HTTP 200, and the page contains tag `boombignose-v0.3.0`. The launcher was checked with `go test`. The smokes are CI processes, not clicks on a physical machine.
