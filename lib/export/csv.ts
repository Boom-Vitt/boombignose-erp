 * Pure string in / string out — no DB, no money math. Route handlers convert
 * satang → baht (numbers) BEFORE handing rows here; this module never formats
 * currency, so numeric columns stay machine-parseable in Excel/Sheets.
 *
 *  - Records are separated by CRLF, the RFC-4180 terminator Excel expects.
 *  - A field is quoted only if it contains `,`, `"`, CR, or LF.
 *  - Internal `"` is escaped by doubling it.
 *  - A UTF-8 BOM is prepended once so Excel detects UTF-8 and renders Thai.
 *  - CSV-injection defense: a string cell starting with `= + - @` (or TAB/CR) is
 *    prefixed with a single quote so Excel/Sheets treat it as text, not a formula.
